                                   CHORUS
                           "Death to the Invader!"

Chorus:           Death to the invader!
                       Strike a deadly blow,
                 As an old Crusader
                       Struck his Paynim foe!
                             Let our martial thunder
                             Fill his soul with wonder,
                             Tear his ranks asunder,
                                   Lay the tyrant low!
                 Death to the invader!
                       Strike a deadly blow,
                 As an old Crusader
                       Struck his Paynim foe!
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <br>

Melissa:          Thus our courage, all untarnish'd,
                       We're instructed to display;
                 But to tell the truth unvarnish'd,
                       We are more inclined to say,
                 "Please you, do not hurt us,"
                 <br>

All:                    "Do not hurt us, if it please you!"
                <br>

Melissa:          "Please you let us be."
<br>

All:                    "Let us be — let us be!"
<br>

Melissa:          "Soldiers disconcert us."
<br>

All:                    "Disconcert us, if it please you!"
<br>

Melissa:          "Frighten'd maids are we!"
<br>

All:                    "Maids are we, maids are we!"
<br>

Melissa:          Please you,
<br>

All:                    Do not hurt us;
<br>

Melissa:          Please you,
<br>

All:                    Let us be.
<br>

Mel & Cho:        Frighten'd maids are we, frighten'd maids are we!
<br>

Melissa:          But 'twould be an error
                 To confess our terror,
                 So in Ida's name,
                 Boldly we exclaim:
<br>

Mel & Cho:        Death to the invader!
                       Strike a deadly blow,
                 As an old Crusader
                       Struck his Paynim foe!

                       Princess:    I like your spirit, girls!  We have to meet
                       Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
                       Wear naught but what is necessary to
                       Preserve your dignity before their eyes,
                       And give your limbs full play.

                       <br>

        
          Blanche:                            One moment, ma'am,
                       Here is a paradox we should not pass
                       Without inquiry.  We are prone to say
                       "This thing is Needful — that, Superfluous"—
                       Yet they invariably co-exist!
                       We find the Needful comprehended in
                       The circle of the grand Superfluous,
                       Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
                       Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful.
                       These singular considerations are—
