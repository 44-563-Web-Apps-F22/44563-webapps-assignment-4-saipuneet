<p>Chorus:           Death to the invader!
                       Strike a deadly blow,
                 As an old Crusader
                       Struck his Paynim foe!
                             Let our martial thunder

                                   Lay the tyrant low!
                 Death to the invader!
                       Strike a deadly blow,
                 As an old Crusader
                       Struck his Paynim foe!</p>

                 But to tell the truth unvarnish'd,
                       We are more inclined to say,
                 "Please you, do not hurt us,"</p>

                       Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
                       Wear naught but what is necessary to
                       Preserve your dignity before their eyes,

         <P><h6>BLA:</h6>                            One moment, ma'am,
                       Here is a paradox we should not pass
                       Without inquiry.  We are prone to say
                       "This thing is Needful — that, Superfluous"—
                       Yet they invariably co-exist!
                       We find the Needful comprehended in
                       The circle of the grand Superfluous,
                       Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
                       Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful.
