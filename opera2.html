        <h3>POGULA SAI PUNEETH</h3>
        <p>
            Princess:    Superfluous, yet not Needful â€” so you see
               The terms may independently exist.
  (To Ladies)       Women of Adamant, we have to show
               That women, educated to the task,
               Can meet Man, face to face, on his own ground,
               And beat him there.  Now, let us set to work;
               Where is our lady surgeon?
               <br>
               <br>

  Sach.:                                    Madam, here!
  <br>
  <br>

  Princess:    We shall require your skill to heal the wounds
               Of those that fall.
               <br>
               <br>

  Sach.:       (Alarmed)        What, heal the wounded?
  <br>
  <br>

  Princess:                                             Yes!
  <br>
  <br>
  Sach.:       And cut off real live legs and arms?
  <br>
  <br>
  Princess:                                 Of course!
  <br>
  <br>
  Sach.:       I wouldn't do it for a thousand pounds!
  <br>
  <br>

  Princess:    Why, how is this?  Are you faint-hearted, girl?
               You've often cut them off in theory!
<br>
<br>
  Sach.:       In theory I'll cut them off again
               With pleasure, and as often as you like,
               But not in practice.
               <br>
               <br>
  Princess:                           Coward!  Get you hence,
               I've craft enough for that, and courage too,
               I'll do your work!  My fusiliers, advance!,
               Why, you are armed with axes!  Gilded toys!
               Where are your rifles, pray?
               <br>
               <br>
  Chloe:                              Why, please you, ma'am,
               We left them in the armoury, for fear
               That in the heat and turmoil of the fight,
               They might go off!
               <br>
               <br>

  Princess:                     "They might!"  Oh, craven souls!
               Go off yourselves!  Thank heaven I have a heart
               That quails not at the thought of meeting men;
               I will discharge your rifles!  Off with you!
               <br>
               <br>

  (Exit Chloe)
               Where's my bandmistress?
<br>
<br>
  Ada:                          Please you, ma'am, the band
               Do not feel well, and can't come out today!
